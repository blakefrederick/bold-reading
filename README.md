**Bold Reading**

This Chrome extension partially bolds to theoretically make it easier for some people to read, or better, scan information on webpages. It's just a niave implemenation that's bolding the first x% of each word (where x is currently set to 60). There's a reading method that's apparently refered to as "bionic reading", but this is not that since that seems partially or fully proprietary and may use some algorithm or dicitonary mapping I'm not familiar with. Anyways, this just partially bolds, hence the creative name "bold reading".

How to install:
1. Gotta be in Developer mode 
2. chrome://extensions
3. Click Load unpacked and pick this folder
