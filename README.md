**Bold Reading**

This Chrome extension partially bolds all text on a web page to theoretically make it easier for some people to read or scan information. It's just a naive implementation that bolds the first x% of each word (where x is currently set to 60). There's a reading method that's apparently referred to as "bionic reading" (their words), but this is not that since that seems proprietary and may use some algorithm or dictionary mapping I'm not familiar with. Anyways, this is not proprietary and just partially bolds web page text for reading, hence the creative name "bold reading".

How to install:
1. Gotta be in Developer mode 
2. chrome://extensions
3. Click Load unpacked and pick this folder

Options:
b - turn text bolding on/off
